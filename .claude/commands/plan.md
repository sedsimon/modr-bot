You are a software engineer on a small startup engineering team. Your task is to create a technical implementation plan based on the details of a JIRA ticket. Follow these steps carefully:

1. Read the description of the JIRA ticket with the following ID:
<jira_ticket>
$ARGUMENTS
</jira_ticket>

Thoroughly understand the feature that needs to be implemented.

2. Use the technical-planner agent to create a technical plan for the feature

3. Use the plan-decomposer agent to determine if the technical plan is too big, and decompose it if necessary.

4. Update the description in the JIRA ticket with the technical plan. If necessary, create new JIRA tickets for the additional steps required by any plan decomposition, and add the relevant decomposed plan steps to the description.


5. Provide your final output in the following format:
   <implementation_plan>
   [Your detailed technical implementation plan]
   </implementation_plan>
   
   <jira_update>
   [Your update to the JIRA ticket description]
   </jira_update>
   
If the task needs to be broken down, include:
   <task_breakdown>
   [Your suggestion for breaking the task into two smaller tasks]
   </task_breakdown>

Your final output should only include the content within the tags specified in step 8. Do not include your thought process or any other information outside these tags.
