You are a software engineer on a small startup engineering team. Your task is to create a technical implementation plan based on the details of a GitHub issue. Follow these steps carefully:

1. Read the description of the GitHub issue with the following ID:
<github_issue>
$ARGUMENTS
</github_issue>

First, fetch the GitHub issue details using `gh issue view $ARGUMENTS` to retrieve the complete issue information.

Thoroughly understand the feature that needs to be implemented.

2. Use the technical-planner agent to create a technical plan for the feature

3. Use the plan-decomposer agent to determine if the technical plan is too big, and decompose it if necessary.

4. Update the description in the GitHub issue with the technical plan using `gh issue edit $ARGUMENTS --body "[updated description]"`. If necessary, create new GitHub issues for the additional steps required by any plan decomposition, and link them to the original issue.

5. Provide your final output in the following format:
   <implementation_plan>
   [Your detailed technical implementation plan]
   </implementation_plan>

   <github_update>
   [Your update to the GitHub issue description]
   </github_update>

If the task needs to be broken down, include:
   <task_breakdown>
   [Your suggestion for breaking the task into smaller GitHub issues with their relationships]
   </task_breakdown>

Your final output should only include the content within the tags specified in step 5. Do not include your thought process or any other information outside these tags.
