# Edge Case Test ADR

## Problem Description
This ADR is designed to test edge cases in parsing and filtering functionality. It contains special characters, unicode, and boundary conditions.

## Drivers
* Test special character handling in tags
* Validate unicode support
* Test edge cases in date parsing
* Ensure robustness with unusual input

## Accepted Solution
Include various edge cases and special characters to ensure the system handles them gracefully.

## Expected Outcome
The system should handle special characters, unicode, and edge cases without errors.

## Trade-offs
* Edge cases might be rare in real usage
* Special characters could cause parsing issues if not handled properly

## Considered Alternatives
1. Avoid special characters entirely
2. Use only ASCII characters
3. Implement strict validation
