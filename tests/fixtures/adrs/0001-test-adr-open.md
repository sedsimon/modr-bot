# API Design Pattern for Data Access

## Problem Description
We need to establish a consistent pattern for accessing data across our microservices architecture. Currently, different teams are implementing different approaches, leading to inconsistencies and maintenance challenges.

## Drivers
* Consistency across teams and services
* Performance optimization
* Maintainability and debugging ease
* Security and access control

## Accepted Solution
Implement a standardized GraphQL API gateway pattern with service-specific resolvers.

## Expected Outcome
All data access will follow the same pattern, reducing cognitive load for developers and improving system observability.

## Trade-offs
* Initial implementation overhead
* Learning curve for teams not familiar with GraphQL
* Potential performance impact for simple queries

## Considered Alternatives
1. REST API with shared libraries
2. Direct database access with shared schemas
3. Event-driven architecture with CQRS
