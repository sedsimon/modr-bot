# Real-time Performance Monitoring

## Problem Description
We lack comprehensive real-time monitoring of application performance metrics, making it difficult to identify and resolve performance issues quickly.

## Drivers
* Proactive issue detection
* Better user experience
* Operational efficiency
* Compliance requirements

## Accepted Solution
This decision has been deferred pending budget approval for Q2 2024.

## Expected Outcome
Real-time visibility into application performance with automated alerting for anomalies.

## Trade-offs
* Additional infrastructure costs
* Learning curve for monitoring tools
* Potential alert fatigue

## Considered Alternatives
1. Open source monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
2. Commercial APM solution (New Relic, DataDog)
3. Cloud-native monitoring tools
